//! Linda Problem: Conjunction Fallacy Demonstration
//!
//! Classic cognitive bias where people judge P(A∧B) > P(A) when A∧B is more
//! "representative" of a description, violating probability axioms.
//!
//! CAFT explains this via amplitude overlap: the conjunction state can have
//! higher amplitude (and thus probability) if it strongly overlaps with the
//! semantically dominant feature.
