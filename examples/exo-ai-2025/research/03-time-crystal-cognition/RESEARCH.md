## 1. Time Crystals: Foundational Physics

### 1.1 Origins and Theoretical Development

**Wilczek's Proposal (2012)**
- Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek proposed the concept of "time crystals" - systems that spontaneously break continuous time translational symmetry
- Originally theorized as quantum systems with perpetual motion in the ground state
- Asked whether time-translation symmetry of a Hamiltonian could be broken in its lowest-energy state

**No-Go Theorems**
- Patrick Bruno and Masaki Oshikawa proved that continuous time crystals cannot occur in equilibrium for ordinary short-range interacting systems
- Watanabe-Oshikawa "no-go" theorem: quantum space-time crystals in equilibrium are impossible
- **Critical insight**: Time symmetry breaking can only occur in non-equilibrium systems

**Discrete Time Crystals (DTCs)**
- DTCs occur in periodically driven (Floquet) systems that break the discrete time symmetry of the driving force
- Respond to periodic driving by oscillating with a period different from (typically a multiple of) the driver
- First experimental verification: Google Sycamore quantum processor (2021)

### 1.2 Google Sycamore Experiments (2021)

**Experimental Achievement**
- Used 20 qubits on Google's Sycamore quantum processor
- Created many-body localization configuration of spins
- Periodic laser stimulation achieved Floquet system with period-doubling oscillations
- **Key finding**: Oscillations at twice the period of driving force - signature of discrete time crystal
- First experimental verification that a phase of matter can exist outside thermal equilibrium

**Limitations**
- Oscillatory signal decays due to ~1% error rate in quantum gate operations
- In theory, oscillations should persist indefinitely
- Demonstrates NISQ (noisy intermediate scale quantum) computing can reveal fundamental physics

**Subsequent Records**
- IBM Brooklyn/Manhattan processors: 57-qubit time crystal (2021)
- University of Colorado Boulder: Visible time crystal using liquid crystals (2022)
- **Dortmund University record**: 40-minute stability (2024) - nearly 10 million times longer than previous 5ms record
- Suggests time crystals could potentially persist for hours or longer

### 1.3 Floquet Time Crystals and Driven Systems (2024-2025)

**Higher-Order and Fractional DTCs (Nature Communications, Dec 2024)**
- Experimentally observed in Rydberg atomic dissipative systems
- Periodic Floquet driving of many-body quantum systems
- **Higher-order DTCs**: System response at integer multiples of driving period
- Demonstrated robustness against perturbations within parameter range

**Discrete Time Quasicrystals (Physical Review X, 2025)**
- Quasiperiodic drive (not purely periodic) produces time quasicrystals
- **Key innovation**: Subharmonic responses at multiple incommensurate frequencies
- Unlike conventional time crystals with single subharmonic
- First experimental evidence in strongly interacting spin ensembles in diamond
- Opens new phase space for temporal matter

**Photonic Time Crystals (Oct 2025)**
- Optical materials with properties modulated on timescales comparable to optical cycle
- Plasmonic implementation using carrier effective mass variations
- Extends Floquet physics to photonic metamaterials
- Potential applications in light manipulation and novel optical devices

**Key Theoretical Insight**
- Periodically driven systems generally heat to infinite temperature
- **Prethermal regime**: High-frequency Floquet systems exhibit long-lived transient states
- Prethermal regime enables Floquet-engineering and non-equilibrium order
- Discrete time crystals emerge as robust phases in this prethermal window

### 1.4 Classical Time Crystals (2024)

**Parametric Oscillator Systems (Phys. Rev. Lett., Dec 2024)**
- Classical weakly nonlinear parametrically driven coupled oscillators
- Models period-doubling instabilities in:
  - Josephson junction arrays
  - Semiconductor laser systems
  - Nanoelectromechanical systems
- **Classical DTC order**: Time scale scales exponentially with system size
- Analogous to equilibrium symmetry breaking

**Key Difference: Dissipation vs. Many-Body Localization**
- Quantum DTCs: Many-body localization (MBL) prevents heating
- Classical DTCs: Dissipation (coupling to heat bath) prevents heating
- No known classical analogue of MBL
- Examples: Faraday parametric resonators, vibrating strings

**Non-Equilibrium Foundation**
- DTCs are "open" systems kept out of equilibrium by environmental energy input
- Never reach thermal equilibrium
- Exhibit oscillations with period different from (typically multiple of) driving force

- Support temporal organization and associative encoding across modalities
- Delta oscillations prominent during focused search in spatial navigation

### 2.2 Working Memory and Persistent Activity

**Memory "Crystallization" (Nature, 2024 - UCLA Study)**
- Transformation in working memory circuits (secondary motor cortex) as mice repeated tasks
- **Early learning**: Memory representations unstable
- **After practice**: Memory patterns "crystallize" - solidify and stabilize
- Delay and choice-related activities drift during learning, stabilize after expert performance

**Traditional Persistent Activity Model**
- Working memory maintained through persistent neural discharges
- Network centered on prefrontal cortex
- Recently challenged: Additional mechanisms proposed
  - Synchronization of neural oscillations
  - Latent storage processes
- Both conscious processing AND sustained activity traditionally thought necessary

**Activity-Silent Short-Term Memory**
- Recent evidence: Information can be stored without conscious awareness or persistent activity
- "Activity-silent short-term memory" vs. "working memory"
- **Critical distinction**: Manipulating information (e.g., rotation) requires both consciousness AND persistent activity
- Brief storage possible without either

**Hippocampal Role (2024)**
- Single neuron recordings in human medial temporal lobe

- Synchronization of time cell pairs regulated by theta rhythms
- Coordinated temporal processing across distributed brain regions

**Time Cells and Contextual Coding**
- Two populations in bat hippocampal CA1:
  1. **Contextual time cells**: Different temporal sequences at different locations
  2. **Pure time cells**: Similar preferred times across spatial contexts
- Conjunction encoding vs. pure elapsed time representation

**Episode-Specific Neurons (Nature Human Behaviour)**
- Individual neurons code discrete episodic memories
- Use rate code or temporal firing code

- **Phase-coded memories** correspond to stable limit cycles
- Networks function as two phase-coupled oscillators
- Two functional modules:
  1. Oscillation generator
  2. Coupling function between internal and external oscillations

**Memory Storage as Attractors**
- Time-varying attractors more resilient to noise than fixed points
- Limit cycles preserve time-varying persistent activity
- Context-dependent working memory maintained via limit cycles
- Learned sequences repeat periodically beyond single sequence duration

### 3.2 Symmetry Breaking and Nonequilibrium Dynamics

**Critical Limitation of Symmetric Networks**
- Symmetric connectivity (J_ij = J_ji) restricted to gradient dynamics
- **Cannot generate**: Sequential behavior, limit cycles, strange attractors, chaos
- Gradient descent on energy landscape - reaches fixed points

**Asymmetric Networks: Nonequilibrium Regime**
- Asymmetric connectivity (J_ij ≠ J_ji) breaks detailed balance
- Drives network into nonequilibrium regime
- **Enables**: Robust temporal structure encoding
  - Sequential pattern activation
  - Limit cycles
  - Complex dynamic attractors (chaos)
- Temporal behaviors inaccessible to classical associative memory models

**Network Structure Optimization**
- Two structures maximize limit behaviors:
  1. Fully-connected and symmetric
  2. Highly sparse and asymmetric
- **Sparse asymmetric** similar to biological neuronal circuits
- Sparse systems have more basins of attraction than dense networks

### 3.3 Attractor Types and Functions

**Cyclic Attractors**
- Model central pattern generators (CPGs)
- Govern oscillatory activity: chewing, walking, breathing
- Regularly recurring states
- Instrumental for rhythmic motor control

**Chaotic and Fixed-Point Attractors**
