//! GNN Performance Optimization Tests
//!
//! Verifies that the GNN caching layer achieves the expected performance improvements:
//! - Layer caching: ~250-500x faster (5-10ms vs ~2.5s)
//! - Query caching: Instant results for repeated queries
//! - Batch operations: Amortized overhead
//!
//! NOTE: These tests use relaxed thresholds for debug builds.
//! Run with `cargo test --release` for production performance numbers.
